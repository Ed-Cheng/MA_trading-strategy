The baseline we are comparing here is the DCA strategy, which is the simplest strategy an investor can do (invest a sum of money over a fixed period of time, usually after they receive their pay each month).

## Developing trading strategy: 
Trades according to the moving average. Prevents losses during the bear market, but also misses the explosive growth of the bull market. 

## Improving the strategy: 
Switch between DCA and MA trading strategies depending on the bull/bear market. Proven effective. Could improve bull/bear market identification.

## Improving bull/bear market identification: 
A significant improvement has been seen. The next step is to fine-tune the parameters.

## Fine-tuning and the final results: 
Pretty promising findings.
